# AX21RestClient

With the help of this project you can do rest calls to your TP Link Archer AX21/1800 router.
It has encrypted API so it is impossible to directly call and use it rest api.

I needed to check internet conectivity from a host within a local network  and reboot the router since it has a tendency to not get dynamic ip after power outeges.

I got inspired by the work of Oriol Castej√≥n https://the-hyperbolic.com/posts/hacking-the-tlwpa4220-part-3/

Archer AX21 is newer than the router used in the mentioned post. This one uses two RSA keys and one AES compared to  the previous one mentioned in the post.



## Basic Usage
```
restClient = RouterRestClient('192.168.0.1', 'router password')
restClient.get_rsa_keys()
restClient.login()
restClient.reboot()
restClient.logout()
```


## Use with docker

### To build just run a command
```
./build.sh
```

### To execute
```
docker run tplink-api:1.0 bash -c "./checkInternet.sh 8.8.8.8 192.168.0.1 password"
```

## To Make an API call from command line
```
#status?form=all   operation=read
python3 RestClient.py -p router_password -t 192.168.0.1 -path status -f all -o read
```
